## Task Description.
### Homework 1. Docker.
1. Integrated repository into Travis CI and Slack.
2. Played a little bit with docker.

## Remarks.
1. Quite interresting command:
    ```bash
    docker system df 
    ```

   It shows how many disk space used by images, containers and volumes. And show how many of them (images, containers and volumes) can be deleted.
